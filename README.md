## Interactive Data Visualization of time series spatial data

## Tools used for the visualization

    # using D3.js, DC.js, Leaflet.js and Javascript.

1.I am using CSS and HTML to position and style the data visualization.

2.dc.js is a great JavaScript library to create interactive charts and a corresponding table. It's built upon d3 and crossfilter helps us to build simple AND Interactive charts quickly.

    1.Piecharts for Year, Month, Date
    2.Barcharts for Temperature and Depth
    3.Rowchart for serach Number of records per year
    4.DataTable for view filtered data

3.Leaflet will be used to create an interactive map.Leaflet is easy to use and plays nicely with openstreetmap tiles.

## Spatial Data

A CTD instrument is used to take measurements of several variables over depth for the study of seasonal and annual trends. The data for the past 19 years are available to download as a text file from
https://www.dropbox.com/s/nz2xotqglirl0wy/L4_CTDf_ODV_format.txt?dl=0

The visualization use the time series spatial data that you can access (PML.json).

    1. All the data available in PML.json
    2. First 8000 records available in PML_test.json (for testing purpose only)

## GitHub Link

If you want to run the code, I recommend downloading
the source code from this GitHub repository, navigating to the directory where the all files are
located,[this
link]().
